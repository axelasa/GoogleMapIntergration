# GoogleMapIntergration
In this project I have Intergrated google maps to the android application to help in spoting multiple locations or amenities easier within your mobile app. 
So users can just on the click of a button get services from you or services providers close to them.
I have also Included Clustering of makers as this helps the users zoom in, in oder to have a better view of markers that are so close together,
it also provides a clean view and helps the user understand that a particular area is filled with the amenities that he/she is looking for💪🏿😉
