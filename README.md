# GoogleMapIntergration
In this project I have Intergrated google maps to the android application to help in spoting multiple locations or amenities easier within your mobile app. 
So users can just on the click of a button get services from you or services providers close to them.
I have also Included Clustering of makers as this helps the users zoom in, in oder to have a better view of markers that are so close together,
it also provides a clean view and helps the user understand that a particular area is filled with the amenities that he/she is looking for💪🏿😉.

as you can see the markes that are close together get to be clustered, and the more the user zooms into the maps they get disintergrated into individual markers till they are all left as markers and not clusters.
